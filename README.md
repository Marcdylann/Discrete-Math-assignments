## Course Overview

Discrete Mathematics is foundational for computer science and is essential for understanding algorithms, data structures, cryptography, and more. This course helped strengthen my understanding of mathematical concepts and improve problem-solving skills. Throughout the course, I worked through assignments that involved both theory and practical application, particularly with logical reasoning and combinatorial analysis.

## Topics Covered

The following topics are covered in the assignments:

- **Logic**: Propositional logic, predicates, logical equivalence, proofs
- **Set Theory**: Set operations, relations, functions, and cardinality
- **Graph Theory**: Graph representation, connectivity, paths, trees, and traversals
- **Combinatorics**: Counting principles, permutations, combinations, binomial theorem
- **Proof Techniques**: Induction, contradiction, direct proof

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the assignments to understand the solutions for various problems in discrete math. Each assignment includes detailed solutions and step-by-step explanations of how the problems were approached.

### Requirements

- No specific software is required, though familiarity with discrete math topics will help you understand the content better.
